# Abstract Motion #3

## Year
2024

## Medium
Digital print on aluminum

## Dimensions
24" x 36"

## Description
Part of my ongoing exploration of movement and color, this piece uses digital techniques to capture the essence of motion in a static medium. The flowing forms suggest both natural phenomena like water currents and more abstract concepts like the passage of time.

## Technical Process
Created using custom algorithms that simulate fluid dynamics, then refined through digital painting techniques before being printed on aluminum for a luminous quality that changes with viewing angle and lighting conditions.
