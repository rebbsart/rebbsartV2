"Urban Motion" captures the energy and dynamism of city life through multiple exposures and digitally composited images. The layering of moments creates a visual representation of how we experience urban environmentsâ€”as overlapping impressions rather than static scenes.

## Technical Details
Created from over 200 photographs taken over a 24-hour period at a single intersection, then carefully composed to preserve both clarity and complexity in the final image.
