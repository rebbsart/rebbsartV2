## Description
Feng-shui (风水) is both an art and a philosophy that seeks to create harmonious and auspicious environments by introducing positive changes and adjustments to our surroundings. However, at its core, this evolved ancient practice is about cultivating balanced, wholesome relationships between yingyang, qi & the five elements, and humanity & nature. It is a philosophy deeply rooted in Taoist origins, with theoretical foundations that present nature as sentient and animated by energies.

With that in mind, I became interested in translating feng-shui principles and philosophy into book design - which led to the creation of this book.

The book, “Feng-Shui: The Ancient Wisdom of Harmonious Living for Modern Times” by Eva Wong served as the foundation for this project. It provided me with an in-depth study of feng shui and became the sole source of material that I used, adapted, and remixed to produce this book.

The cover of this book reflects feng-shui principles of protection, where the front view of a site should not be fully blocked but protection is still required to cushion incoming forces.
