# Textural Study #7

## Year
2024

## Medium
Encaustic and found objects on wood panel

## Dimensions
24" x 24"

## Description
This piece from my ongoing Textural Study series explores the interplay between surface, depth, and embedded meaning. The encaustic medium allows for both translucency and opacity, creating layers that partially reveal and conceal the objects embedded within.

## Process Notes
Created through an iterative process of heating, applying, carving, and embedding materials. Each layer reacts to and influences the previous and subsequent applications of medium.
