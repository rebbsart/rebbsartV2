# Recursive Forms

## Year
2025

## Medium
3D printed sculpture, resin coating

## Dimensions
18" x 12" x 12"

## Description
"Recursive Forms" bridges traditional sculptural techniques with digital fabrication methods. The complex geometric patterns could not be realized through conventional means, yet the final piece maintains a tactile, organic quality through post-processing techniques.

## Technical Innovation
Created using a custom algorithm that generates forms based on natural growth patterns. The 3D printed structure was then hand-finished with multiple layers of pigmented resin to achieve depth and luminosity.
